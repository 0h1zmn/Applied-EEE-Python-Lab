# Applied Python for Electrical Engineering & EV Systems

**Objective:** A computational laboratory for simulating, analyzing, and optimizing Battery Management Systems (BMS) using Python.

## 📂 Repository Contents

### 1. Battery Logic & Control
*   Fundamental EV calculations (Watt-hour capacity, C-rate).
*   Charging control loops (CC/CV simulation).
*   Basic circuit modeling.

### 2. Signal Processing & Simulation
*   Synthetic sensor data generation with Gaussian noise injection.
*   Fault detection algorithms (Over-current logic).
